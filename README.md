# LoRA Polytope Complexity

> **Hypothesis:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enforces highly correlated, low-dimensional rotations of ReLU gate hyperplanes (normals), rather than allowing the independent, local fragmentation that Full Fine-Tuning produces.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a rigorous PyTorch experiment that studies the **geometry of ReLU neural network adaptation**. The core question is:

*When adapting a pretrained MLP to a new task, does the rank constraint in LoRA fundamentally change how the decision-boundary geometry evolves, compared to unconstrained Full Fine-Tuning?*

We answer this through a controlled topological experiment: a "Bubble Flip" (XOR patch) is surgically placed inside a region of constant ReLU gate activation, making it geometrically provable that the output head alone cannot solve the task — hyperplane movement in `fc1` is mandatory.

## Scientific Statement

This repository provides geometric evidence supporting the claim: **Low-rank adaptation restricts the dimension of the hyperplane deformation field.** 

This is stronger and more mathematically precise than the typical statement that "LoRA regularizes fine-tuning" (which is vague). Low-dimensional deformation is measurable, as shown in this repo.

---

## Interpretation of the Metrics

⚠️ **Important Clarification:** This repository **does NOT measure the theoretical expressivity** of neural networks. 

Instead, it evaluates **how the decision partition deforms during adaptation.** Low-rank updates restrict the directions in which hyperplane normals can move. This induces a correlated deformation of the partition, rather than the chaotic, independent motion of individual hyperplanes seen in Full Fine-Tuning.

## Architecture

```
Input x ∈ ℝ¹⁰  (data lives on a 2D plane embedded via fixed E : ℝ¹⁰ → ℝ²)
    │
    ▼
fc1: Linear(10 → 32)  ← Normals (rows of W₁) define ReLU hyperplanes
    │
  ReLU
    │
    ▼
fc2: Linear(32 → 1)   ← Binary classification head
    │
    ▼
  ŷ ∈ {0, 1}
```

- **Embedding:** Input `x = E @ u`, where `u ∈ ℝ²` is the true 2D coordinate.
  `E ∈ ℝ^(10×2)` is a fixed orthonormal basis (QR-factored random matrix).
- **Activation:** `nn.ReLU()` (strict; no leaky/ELU variants).

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Task 0** (Pretraining) | Binary circle: `‖u‖ < 0.60` → class 1 |
| **Task 1** (Adaptation)  | Circle **plus** a "Bubble Flip" XOR patch of radius `0.08` placed at a **constant-gate region** inside the circle |

The XOR patch flips labels for points within radius `rb=0.08` of the bubble center `u_c`.

---

## The 5 Mandatory Experimental Safeguards

1. **Topological Trap** — After pretraining, `find_bubble_center()` searches for a point `u_c` where all 32 ReLU gates of `fc1` remain constant throughout the entire bubble. This guarantees the geometry is locally flat.

2. **Head-Only Assert** — The base model (no training) is evaluated on the bubble region under Task 1. Since the gate pattern is constant and the label is flipped, accuracy = 0.0. This *proves* fc2 alone cannot solve it.

3. **Frozen Output & Bias** — During Full FT and LoRA: `fc2.weight`, `fc2.bias`, and `fc1.bias` are all frozen. Only the **normal vectors** (columns of `fc1.weight`) are allowed to change.

4. **Target-Loss Matching** — Both methods train until reaching the same target loss (`0.15`) rather than a fixed epoch count — ensuring no unfair comparison of underfitting vs. convergence.

5. **LoRA on fc1 only** — `W_eff = W₀ + (α/r) · B @ A`, where `A ∈ ℝ^(r×d_in)`, `B ∈ ℝ^(m×r)`, `r=2`. The update is provably rank-2.

## The 4 Core Metrics

| Level | Metric | What it measures |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Update-Matrix-Rank** | `rank(ΔW)` and `stable_rank(ΔW)` in weight space |
| 2 | **Hyperplane-Rotation-Rank** | `stable_rank(ΔN)` where `N` = unit-normalized rows of `W₁` |
| 3 | **Region Creation vs Movement** | Differential count of unique gate patterns on a 2D grid before and after adaptation |
| 4 | **Gate-Drift / Adjacency** | % of area changed; Jaccard distance of the Polytope Adjacency Graph before/after adaptation |
| 5 | **Discrete Boundary Curvature** | Mean, median, and 90th percentile (p90) turning angles of the boundary's geometric normal vector. |
| 6 | **Line-Crossing Complexity** | Crofton-proxy: avg. sign changes of prediction across 256 random lines |

### Curvature Distribution
The mean curvature of the decision boundary is nearly identical between LoRA and full fine-tuning. The difference appears primarily in the tail of the distribution. Full fine-tuning produces slightly more extreme turning angles, while LoRA suppresses the largest boundary kinks. This supports the interpretation that low-rank adaptation limits extreme local deformations while preserving global flexibility.

### Theoretical Connection: Tropical Geometry
The rotation-rank metric is essentially measuring the **dimension of the normal fan deformation of the ReLU partition**. In terms of tropical and polyhedral geometry: 
`rank(ΔW) → dimension of Newton polytope deformation`.
LoRA's low-rank structure geometrically bounds the complexity of the topological changes applied to the data manifold.

## Experimental Extensions (Depth Ablation)

One conceptual limitation of the 1-layer architecture is that it isolates geometry nicely, but leaves open the question: *Does the effect survive deep composition?* Deep ReLU networks can create exponentially many regions.

To address this, the codebase includes `experiments/run_depth.py`, where LoRA is applied **only to the first layer** across `depth = 1`, `4`, and `8` networks to test whether the geometric restriction imposed at the first layer survives deep composition.

Empirically we observe that even at depth 8:
- LoRA updates remain strictly low-rank
- The model still solves the task (>96% accuracy)
- Boundary deformation remains correlated rather than chaotic

This suggests that deep nonlinear composition can amplify a low-dimensional deformation field without destroying its structure.
